Parameters

Licensor:             ammanade
Licensed Work:        GoEngine. The Licensed Work is (c) 2025 ammanade.
Additional Use Grant: You may make production use of the Licensed Work, provided
                      Your use does not include offering the Licensed Work to third
                      parties on a hosted or embedded basis in order to compete with
                      commercial versions of the Licensed Work. For purposes of this license:

                      A "competitive offering" is a Product that is offered to third
                      parties on a paid basis, including through paid support
                      arrangements, that significantly overlaps with the capabilities
                      of GoEngine. If Your Product is not a competitive offering when
                      You first make it generally available, it will not become a competitive
                      offering later due to GoEngine releasing a new version with additional
                      capabilities. In addition, Products that are not provided on a paid basis 
                      are not competitive.

                      "Product" means software that is offered to end users to manage
                      in their own environments or offered as a service on a hosted
                      basis.

                      "Embedded" means including the source code or executable code
                      from the Licensed Work in a competitive offering. "Embedded"
                      also means packaging the competitive offering in such a way
                      that the Licensed Work must be accessed or downloaded for the
                      competitive offering to operate.

                      Hosting or using the Licensed Work(s) for internal purposes
                      within an organization is not considered a competitive
                      offering.

Change Date:          The Licensed Work will not transition to any other open-source license.
Change License:       Not applicable.
